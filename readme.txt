A natural language chat assistant for WordPress. Ask Wapuu to help you navigate and manage your site!

== Description ==

Hey Wapuu is a conversational assistant for the WordPress admin. Instead of searching through menus or the command palette, you can simply chat with Wapuu in plain English.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Click the Wapuu chat bubble in the bottom right corner of your admin screen to start chatting!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
